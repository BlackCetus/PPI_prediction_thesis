torch.cuda.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 238.00 MiB. GPU 0 has a total capacty of 44.35 GiB of which 38.12 MiB is free. Process 940293 has 42.87 GiB memory in use. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 1.43 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 877.22 MiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 260.78 MiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting max_split_size_mb to avoid fragmentation.  See documentation for Memory Management and PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF
