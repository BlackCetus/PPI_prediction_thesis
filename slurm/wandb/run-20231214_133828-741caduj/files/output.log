torch.cuda.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 2.39 GiB. GPU 0 has a total capacty of 44.35 GiB of which 1.86 GiB is free. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 42.48 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 39.66 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 2.50 GiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting max_split_size_mb to avoid fragmentation.  See documentation for Memory Management and PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF
